# Assignment Four: Blog Management System

In this assignment, you will be creating a system where multiple **authors** can post articles to a shared blog page.  Each of the **authors** should be able to *add new posts and update and delete their existing posts*. An **author** does not have the ability to modify any other author's posts. All of the posts can be viewed by unauthenticated users on the home, post, and about pages. **admin** users have the ability to add, update, and delete system users, and the ability to add, update, and delete any of the posts.
